                    <h2>Summoner's Rift (Normals/Ranked)</h2>
                    <p>
                        The oldest and most venerated Field of Justice is known as the Summoner's Rift.
                        This battleground is known for the constant conflicts fought between two opposing groups of
                        Summoners.
                        Traverse down one of three different paths in order to attack your enemy at their weakest point.
                        Work with your allies to siege the enemy base and destroy their Nexus!
                        There are three major routes in Summoner's Rift namely: top lane, mid lane, and bottom lane.
                        Each lane has two outer turrets and assigned champions. The top lane consists of fighter melee
                        champions, Fighter icon fighters, Slayer icon assassins, and Fighter icon bruisers, or commonly
                        referred to as AD.
                        The mid lane consists of Mage icon mages or AP carries. The bottom lane is made up of Marksman
                        icon
                        marksmen or ADC, Controller icon supports and Tank icon tanks.
                        The Jungle is a sub-lane where Junglers are assigned to control the buffs and set up ganks.
                        The jungle is made up of monsters with the Rift ScuttlerSquare Rift Scuttler being the only non
                        hostile monster and the Baron NashorSquare Baron and DragonSquare Dragon being the only epic
                        monsters on the map of Summoner's Rift.<br>

                    <h2>Howling Abyss (Aram)</h2>
                    <p>
                        - The Howling Abyss is a bottomless crevasse located in the coldest, cruelest, part of the
                        Freljord.
                        Legends say that, long ago, a great battle took place here on the narrow bridge spanning the
                        chasm.
                        No one remembers who fought here, or why, but it is said that if you listen carefully to the
                        wind
                        you can still hear the cries of the vanquished tossed howling into the Abyss.
                        There is only one lane in the Howling Abyss. you cannot Recall Recall or heal in base, but there
                        are
                        heals near the turrets at the edge of the map

                    <h2>Twisted Treeline</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Twisted Treeline was the second classic League of Legends map. It typically features faster,
                        bloodier matches with an emphasis on ganking and small-scale skirmishes.
                        You achieve victory by pushing your way into the opposing base and destroying the enemy nexus.
                        A smaller map than Summoner's Rift, the Twisted Treeline is configured horizontally, with two
                        lanes
                        flanking a neutral area.
                        Turrets are placed along the length of each lane, and the nexus is defended by a single turret.
                        Teams are composed of three champions apiece, and each champion spawns with a substantial sum of
                        gold. The reduced map size and accelerated level curve makes for a shorter game length and
                        higher
                        kill scores.
                        The Twisted Treeline was retired from the game on November 19th for the end of Season Nine.
